# Architecture Decision Records

## Universal

- [1. Record architecture decisions with ADRs](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) — _Accepted_
  Architecturally significant decisions — choices that shape structure, dependencies, interfaces, or the way the team works — need a durable record.

- [2. Develop with Test-Driven Development](0002-use-test-driven-development.md) — _Accepted_
  We want a fast feedback loop, a regression safety net, executable documentation of behavior, and the freedom to refactor without fear.
- [3. Integrate via a PR-based trunk workflow](0003-pr-based-trunk-workflow.md) — _Accepted_
  We want `main` to stay releasable at all times, changes to be reviewable in coherent units, and history to be legible.

- [4. Use the Mikado Method to keep the build green](0004-mikado-method-for-changes.md) — _Accepted_
  Large refactorings, and changes that ripple across a codebase, tempt us into long stretches where nothing compiles and nothing is committable.

- [5. Make CI the merge gate](0005-ci-is-the-merge-gate.md) — _Accepted_
  Standards that are not enforced erode.
  Related: [10. Standardize the Python quality toolchain](0010-python-toolchain.md)
- [6. Keep developer and user documentation current](0006-keep-documentation-current.md) — _Accepted_
  Documentation that lags the code is worse than none — it misleads.

- [7. Declare an explicit license and copyright](0007-license-and-copyright.md) — _Accepted_
  A repository with no license is "all rights reserved" by default — others (and future us) have no clear terms for use, and intent is ambiguous.
- [8. Maintain a security baseline](0008-security-baseline.md) — _Accepted_
  Secrets committed to a repository are effectively public and permanent — history preserves them even after deletion.

## Language

- [9. Structure Python projects with pyproject and a src layout](0009-python-project-layout.md) — _Accepted_
  Python offers many ways to lay out and package a project, and inconsistent choices make repositories harder to move between.

- [10. Standardize the Python quality toolchain](0010-python-toolchain.md) — _Accepted_
  The universal CI-gate decision requires formatting, tests, and coverage thresholds to be enforced, but leaves the *tools* to each language.

## App shape

- [11. CLI conventions](0011-cli-conventions.md) — _Accepted_
  Command-line tools are used by people at a terminal and by scripts and CI.
